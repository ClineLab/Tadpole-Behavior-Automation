# Tadpole Behavior Automation

This is a Matlab scrip and funtion for use in automating the avoidance behavior analysis of Xenopus tadpoles. To run this script it is necessary to download the BatchRunTAD9000.m and the TadFunctionTest.m. Currently the Tad_Det_Assign_9001.m is the test file kept up to date with the TadFunctionTest.m that is used for testing and confirmation purposes.
